# 🎓 Teacher Performance Rewards System

## 📚 Project Description

The **Teacher Performance Rewards System** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to incentivize and reward teachers based on their performance metrics. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity, this system enables educational institutions to manage and distribute Ether-based rewards to teachers in a transparent, automated, and secure manner. By leveraging smart contracts, the system ensures that teachers are fairly rewarded according to their performance scores, which are updated and managed by the institution's administrators.

### 🔗 Contract Address

The smart contract for the Teacher Performance Rewards System is deployed at the following Ethereum address:

**`0x3664c7976AaD7Ad7ab1877d2FB49D61c3c2f4e24`**

This address can be used to interact with the smart contract on the Ethereum network.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🛡️ Decentralized Reward Distribution**: Automatically calculate and distribute Ether rewards to teachers based on their performance scores.
- **👩‍🏫 Teacher Management**: Easily add teachers to the system and update their performance scores as needed.
- **🔐 Secure and Transparent**: Ensure that rewards are distributed securely on the Ethereum blockchain, with all transactions being transparent and verifiable.
- **🔑 Owner-Only Controls**: Access to key functions, such as adding teachers, updating scores, and distributing rewards, is restricted to the contract owner to maintain control and integrity.
- **📜 Event Logging**: All reward distributions are logged via events, providing an auditable trail of transactions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The **Teacher Performance Rewards System** aims to revolutionize how educational institutions recognize and reward their educators. By automating the reward process and utilizing blockchain technology, the system provides a fair, transparent, and immutable method of incentivizing teachers. This project envisions a future where teacher motivation and performance are enhanced, leading to better educational outcomes and a more motivated workforce. Through decentralization and smart contracts, the project seeks to eliminate bias and human error in the reward process, ensuring that every teacher receives the recognition they deserve.
